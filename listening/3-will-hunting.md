Will: So what's this? A ??? *Taster's* Choice moment between guys? This is really nice.
You ~gotta think for swans it's like they are fattish~ got a thing for swans? Is this like a fetish?
It's something like maybe we need to devote some time to.

Sean: Thought about what you said to me the other day, about my painting.

Will: Huh?

Sean: Stayed up half the night thinking about it... and something occurred to me... I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't though about you since. You know what occurred to me?

Will: No.

Sean: You're just a kid. You don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.

Will: Why, thank you.

Sean: It's alright. You've never been out of Boston?

Will: Nope.

Sean: If I asked you about art, you'd probably give me the skinny on every art book ever written.
Michelangelo. You know a lot about him, life's work, political aspirations, him and the Pope, sexual orientation,
the whole works, right? I bet you can't tell me what it smells like in the Sistine Chapel. You never actually
stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling, seen that. If I ask you about women, you probably
give me a ??? *syllabus* of your personal favorites. You may have even been laid a few times. But you can't tell me what
it feels like to wake up next to a woman and feel truly happy. You're a tough kid. If I ask you about war,
you probably throw Shakespear at me, right? "Once more, into the breach, dear friends!" But you've never been
near one. You've never held your best friend's head near lap and watch him gasp his last breath, looking to you
for help. If I ask you about love, you probably quote me a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been
totally vulnerable, known someone ~to get~ who could level with you with her eyes, feeling like God put an angel on Earth
just for you. Who could rescue you from the depth of hell and you would know what it's like to be her angel.
To have that love for her to be there forever, through anything, through cancer. And you would know about sleeping
sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand, because the doctors could see in your eyes that the
terms "visiting hours" don't apply to you. You don't know about real loss 'cause it only occurs when you love
someone more that you love yourself. I doubt you've ever dared to love anybody that much. I look at you, I don't see
an intelligent, confident man, I see a cocky, scared-shitless kid. But you're a genius, Will, no one denies that.
No one could possibly understand the depth of you... But you presume to know everything about me because you saw
a painting of mine and you ripped my fucking life apart. You're an orphan, right? Do you think I know the first thing
about how hard your life has been, how you feel, who you are because I read ??? *Oliver* Twist? Does that encapsulate
you? Personally, I don't give a shit about all that, because you know what? I can't learn anything from you, I can't
read in some fucking book unless you wanna talk about you, who you are. And I'm fascinated, I'm in. But you don't
wanna do it, do you, sport? You're terrified of what you might say. Your move, chief.
