So I'd like you to imagine for a moment that you're a soldier in the heat of battle.
Maybe you're a roman foot soldier or a medieval archer or maybe you're a zulu warrior,
regardless of your the time and place, there are some things that are constant -- your adrenaline
is elevated and your actions are stemming from these deeply ingrained reflexes, reflexes
rooted in ~the~ a need to protect yourself and your side and to defeat the enemy.
So now I'd like you to imagine playing a very different role, that of the scout.
So the scout's job is not to attack or defend, the scout's job is to understand.
The scout is the one going out, mapping the terrain, identifying potential obstacles
and the scout may hope to learn that, say, there's bridge in a conventient location
across the river but above all the scout wants to know what's really there as accurately
as possible. And in a real, actual army both the soldier and the scout are essential, but
you can also think of each of these roles as a mindset, a metaphor for how all of us
process information and ideas in our daily lives and what I'm going to argue today is
that having good judgment, making accurate predictions, making good decisions is mostly
about which mindset you're in. So, to illustrate these mindsets in action I'm going to take
you back to XIX century France where this innocuous looking piece of paper launched one of the
biggest political scandals in history. It was discovered in 1894 by officers in the French
general staff and it was torn up in a wastepaper basket but when they pieced it back together
they discovered that someone in their ranks had been selling military secrets to Germany.
So they launched a big investigation and their suspicions quickly converged on this man,
Alfred Dreyfus. He had a sterling record, no past history of wrongdoing, no motive as far
as they could tell, but Dreyfus was the only jewish officer at that rank in the army and
unfortunately at this time the french army was highly anti-semitic. So they compared Dreyfus's
handwriting to that on the memo and concluded that is was a match even though outside
professional handwriting experts were much less confident in the similarity.
But nevermind that, they went and searched Dreyfus's apartment, looking for any signs of
espionage, went through his files and they didn't find anything and this just convinced
them more that not only Dreyfus was guilty, but sneaky as well, because clearly he had
hidden all the evidence before they had managed to get to it. Next they went to look
through his personal history for any incriminating details, they talked to his teachers,
they found he had studied foreign languages in school which clearly showed the desire
to conspire with foreign governments in later life. His teachers also said that Dreyfus had
a good memory, you know, known for having a good memory, which was highly suspicious, right?
You know, because a spy has to remember a lot of things. So case went to trial and
Dreyfus was found guilty and afterwards they took him out into this public square, and
ritualisticly tore his insignia from his uniform and broke his sword in two. This is called
"The Degradation of Dreyfus". And they sentenced him to life imprisonment on the aptly named
Devil's Island, which is just this barren rock off the coast of South America. So there he
went, there he spent his days alone, writing letters and letters to the french government,
begging them to reopen his case so they could discover his innocence. But for the most part
France considered the case closed. So one thing that's really interesting to me about
the Dreyfus affair is this question of why the officers were so convinced that Dreyfus
was guilty. I mean you might even assume that they were setting him up, that they were
intentionally framing him, but historians don't think that's what happened.
As far as we can tell, the officers genuinely believed that the case against Dreyfus was strong,
which, you know, makes you wonder, what does it say about the human mind, that we can find such poltry evidence to
be compelling enough to convict a man. Well, this is the case of what scientists call a motivated
reasoning, it's this phenomenon in which our unconscious motivations, our desires and fears shake
the way we interpret information. So some information, some ideas feel like our allies
and we want... we want them to win, we want to defend them. And other information or ideas
are the enemy and we want to shoot them down. So this is why I call motivated reasoning
"soldier mindset". And probably most of you have never prosecuted a french jewish officer
for high treason, I assume, uh, but maybe you follow sports or politics, so you might've
noticed that, uh, when a referee judges that your team committed a foul, for example,
you're highly motivated to find reasons to find why he's wrong, but if he judges that
the other heam committed a foul -- awesome, that's a good call, let's not examine
it too closely. Or maybe you've read an article or a study that examined some controversial
policy, like capital punishment, and as researchers have demonstrated, if... if you support capital
punishment and the study shows that it's not effective, then you're highly motivated to
find all the reasons why the study was poorly designed, but if it shows that the capital
punishment works -- awesome, it's a good study. And vice versa, if you don't support
capital punishment -- same thing. Our judgements are just strongly influenced unconsciously
by which side we want to win. And this is ubiquitous, this shapes how we think about our
health, our relationships, how we decide how to vote, what we consider fair or ethical.
And what's most scary to me about motivated reasoning or soldier's mindset is how
unconscious it is, you know, we can think we're being objective and fair-minded and still
wind up ruining the life of an innocent man. Howewer, fortunately for Dreyfus, his story
is not over, this is Colonet Picquart, he's another high-ranking officer in the french army
and like most people he assumed that Dreyfus was guilty, also, like most people in the army,
he was at least casually anti-semitic. But at a certain point Picquart began to suspect
"Ugh, what if we're all wrong about Dreyfus?" What happened is that he discovered that
the spying for Germany had continued even after Dreyfus was in prison and he'd also
discovered that another officer in the army had handwriting that perfectly matched the memo,
much closer than Dreyfus's handwriting. So he brought his discoveries to his superiors but
to his dismay they either didn't care or came up with elaborate rationalizations
to explain his findings, like "uh, well, all you've really shown, Picquart, that there's
another spy who learned how to mimic Dreyfus's handwriting and he, you know, picked up the torch
of spying after the Dreyfus left, but Dreyfus is still guilty". Eventually Picquart managed
to get Dreyfus exonerated but it took him 10 years and for part of that time he himself
was in prison for the crime of disloyalty to the army. So, you know, a lot of people feel like
Picquart can't really be the hero of this story because he was an anti-semite and that's bad,
which I agree with, but personally for me, the fact that Picquart was anti-semitic actually
makes his actions more admirable because he had the same prejudices, the same reasons
to be biased as his fellow officers but his motivation to find the truth and uphold it
just trumped all of that. So to me Picquart is a poster child of what I call "scout mindset."
It's the drive not to make one idea win and another lose, but just to see what's really there
as honestly and accurately as you can, even if it's not pretty or convenient or pleasant.
And this mindset is what's I'm personally passionate about and what I've spent the last few
years examining and trying to figure out what causes scout mindset, you know, why are some
people, sometimes at least, able to cut through their own prejudices and biases and
motivations and just try to the facts and the evidence as objectively as they can.
And the answer is emotional, so just as soldier mindset is rooted in emotions like
defensiveness or tribalism, scout mindset is too, it's just rooted in different emotions.
So, for example, scouts are curious, they are more likely to say they feel pleasure when
they learn new information or an itch to solve a puzzle. They're more likely to feel
intrigued when they encounter something that contradicts their expectations. Scouts also
have different values, they're more likely to say they think it's virtuous to test your
own beliefs and they are less likely to say that someone who changes his mind seems weak.
And above all scouts are grounded which means their self-worth as a person isn't tied
to how right or wrong they are about a particular topic. So, you know, they can believe that
the capital punishment works and if studies come out showing that it doesn't they can say
"Huh, looks like I might be wrong, doesn't mean I'm bad or stupid, you know". So these traits,
this cluster of traits is what researchers have found and I've also found anecdotally
predicts good judgment and the key takeaway I want to leave you with about those traits is
that they're not primarily about how smart you are or about how much you know, in fact
they don't correllate very much with IQ at all, they're about how you feel, so there's a quote that
I keep coming back to by St. Exupery, he's the author of "The Little Prince" and he said
"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up your men to collect wood and give orders and
distribute the work. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea". In other
words, I claim, if we want to really improve our judgment as individuals and as societies
what we need most is not more instruction in logic or ~???~ rhetoric or probability or economics,
even though those things are quite valuable, but what we most need to use those principles
well is scout mindset, we need to change the way we feel, we need to learn how to feel proud,
instead of ashamed when we notice we might have been wrong about something. We need to learn
how to feel intrigued instead of defensive when we encounter some information that contradicts
our beliefs. So the question I want to leave you with is "What do you most yearn for?" Do you
yearn to defend your own beliefs or do you yearn to see the worlds as clearly as you
possibly can? Thank you.
