E: You have major fans, people are... What do they call themselves, your fans?
B: The call themselves a lot of things.
E: But mainly?
B: One, er, cumberbitches.
E: Cumberbitches?
B: Yeah, yeah... It like... got to squeeze a confession out of me to actually say that word cause I'm kinda squirm a little bit about it
E: Yeah, that's why I didn't want to say it, I made you say it
B: Yeah, no, thank you
E: But they named themselves cumberbitches?
B: They did, I didn't definitely name them, that's part of my problem, I just went: "You know, ladies, this is wonderful, I'm very flattered, you know,
   but has this not set feminism back a little bit, you know?"
E: Right
B: Empower yourselves if you're going to get silly about a guy with maybe a little bit more of, you know, sort of high regard, self-regarded name, but yeah...
   They were very sweet and wrote back to me: "We didn't mean any harm to feminism, we're just having a bit of fun with your name"
E: It's a hard name, but then all of a sudden it's a name that everybody knows because you're in so many great movies
B: Thank you
E: When I was hosting last year and you were trying to get by and it was the exact moment cause you were getting ready to present and it was very tight
   quarters backstage and I was in my The Good Witch costume that I went out in...
B: You were
E: And this is... I think we have a... We had to subtitle it cause you can't really hear... But this is us backstage right before he's going on.

[SUBTITLED CLIP]

E: So you were on the red...
B: Didn't you do a great job last year? That was amazing! You did, you did because that was my first time there as well and, you know, people warned me
   it could be a long night and no matter how much fun people doing your job make it, it can be a long night. You made it seamless, flawless, funny as hell
   and really inclusive and everyone was having... you know, sort of ~~thrilled, so~~ **Pharell's song** "Happy", there were a lot of feet dancing, you know,
   that spirit didn't really leave the room until the end, it was great.
E: Yeah, it was great, ~~???~~ Pharell singing happy and U2 was there, it was great, it was a wonderful experience, a great night, great movies. And I think you were
   a little tipsy by the time you got in...
B: Thanks to your team! Yeah, you game me some vodka on the red carpet... I mean, if for no other reason I blame that on how high I jumped. There you go, yeah!
   Proof!
E: ~~You~~ **It's just a** small amount right there. So now you're like an award show professional because at the Globes the other night...
B: ~~???~~
E: You kind of are, because you're photobombing everybody in sight now.
B: But I... And somebody asked me, for the red carpet... That's never going to happen again, that was a one-off thing. Meryl Streep and someone from North Korea stood
   in front of me for about 5 minutes trying to take a photo... This is ridiculuous and I just jumped up and did it again
E: It was a fantastic picture! Someone from North Korea. You got it!
B: It's not me, it's just a ~~carbon~~ **cardboard** cutout people carry around
E: That's you, you do it all the time, I've seen it before. So you got engaged, congratulations. And then you're gonna have a tiny little baby?
B: Or big, we don't know yet. Or a huge baby. But a baby.
E: You're going to have a tiny or a big baby. I was kinda... yeah... You're going to have some kind of baby.
B: Gonna have some kind of baby
E: And you don't know if it a boy or a girl yet
B: Not yet, no.
E: Okay, I have some names that I tweeted out I want to remind you of.
B: Ooh, okay.
E: Because your last name, Cumberbatch, you have to be careful with the first name.
B: Yeah, true.
E: So... Engelbert is one name I came up with. Engelbert Cumberbatch?
B: Engelbert Cumberbatch? Yeah...
E: Harpsichord, that could be a boy or a girl.
B: Harpsichord, that could. A unisex instrument!
E: Glockenspiel.
B: Definitely a boy. Definitely a boy, german boy ~~laid in the house~~ **in lederhosen** maybe, but yeah...
E: Or Carl.
B: Carl?
E: Mm-mhm.
B: Carl Cumberbatch?
E: Uh-huh.
B: I'm not getting it.
E: Uh-huh... There's nothing to get.
B: Right, it's just a name.
