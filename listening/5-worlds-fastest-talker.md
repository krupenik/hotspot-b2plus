I first discovered this talent when I was a little child and it's been of absolutely no use to me since then. In fact, during
part of my early life I deliberately ignored the talent because it was getting me into all sorts of trouble, then ???
I realized that perhaps I could capitalize on it so I went from there.

People used to tell me I'd use 100 words where 2 words would do. I first broke world record back in 1991 and I've broken it
5 times since then and held it for 10 years except for 3 days when I lost it to a woman I wasn't going to be outdone by a woman
so I got it back almost immediately. Chris Bonnington climbed Everest because he was there and I broke this world record
because I can break this world record and that's why I did it. I don't know if people think I'm absolutely bananas, I think
I'm absolutely bananas, I've got 1 wife, 8 kids, 4 cats, 2 dogs, loads of tropical fish and a guinea pig. I mainly rehearse
the passage that I'm going to break the world record with over and over again, the trick is to get the breathing right.
If you can breathe as little as possible then you're fast, so the less breath I'm taking the faster I become. When I
originally broke the world record the technology wasn't available to do it electronically so what they had to do is they
had to record me at my full speed and then play the tape back 1 second at a time and the judicator was familiar with what
it was that I was saying so he could listen to the tape a second at a time and say "Yes, that was there, yes, that was there,
no, that wasn't there." In the last two years the computer technology has become available to physically slow me down and
remodulate the pitch so you can actually hear exactly what I'm saying.

It has 2 major advantages to me. First of all, I can actually have an argument with my wife and I've finished before she
said the first word. And the second thing is of course my cellular phone bills are tiny compared to everybody else. The actual
speed is 637 words per minute, that's how fast I can speak, that's actually 10.25 words per second. To give you an idea of
the speed of that, a Greyhound horse racing commentator, auctioneer could probably just approach 300 words per minute.
The average person speaking like I am now speaks at about 2 words per second, so that's 120 words per minute so I'm speaking
almost 6 times faster than that. It's so fast that if you were reading a ??? passage that I was speaking, by the time you've
thought about a word that I've said I'd run in by 20 words. When most people read a passage out loud what they do is their
eyes take the information in and there's a little voice inside their head which tells them what exactly they're about to say
and all they do is they repeat that voice. What I do is I absord the information in through my eyes and it actually comes
straight out through my mouth so I'd be effectively switching my brain off. I was one in a radio studio in New York in 1995
demonstrating my talent and I had a particularly hot windy ??? the night before. Unfortunately at this radio station the
air conditioning has broken down and one thing you do do when you're talking fast is you swallow tremendous amounts of air.
About 30 seconds through it I couldn't help it, I just let it rip and ??? the whole studio ??? ??? ??? ??? ??? live to something
like 6 million listeners. I'll never live that down. If somebody else breaks the world record and takes it away from me,
that might give me the ??? and will to get the world record back, but personally I don't think I can reach that speed again.

??? I think it's a useless world record but it is a world record so it's my piece of fame.

To be or not to be -- that is the question...
