R: Let me ask you about uh... violence. I mean you said, you know, everyone knows you make violent movies, you like violent movies. Why do you like making violent movies?
T: I don't... This is like asking Judd Apatow "Why do you like making comedies?"
R: You just get a kick out of it, or you just enjoy it, or?
T: It's uh... I think it's good cinema, I consider it good cinema, you know, you sit there in a movie theater when this cathartic violence scenes happen.
   I'm talking about cathartic violence scenes, I'm not talking about... You know, there's two types of violence in this movie, there's the brulality of the
   violence in the day, put upon the slaves, during the time...
R: The rape...
T: I don't think there's any rape going on in the movie, but... alright. But there's brutality to the slaves. That hasn't been dealt with in America to the extend that I deal with it.
   And I'm showing you that there's was, you know, there was two holocausts in America, this is one of them. We've dealt with the Indian Holocaust, the holocaust of the
   American-Indian in America, but we haven't been dealing with the holocaustic aspects. The Auschwitzian aspects of the slave trade in America, my movie deals with that.
   Then there's the cathartic violence of Django paying back blood for blood.
R: And that's what... Is that why you think people like watching violent movies? People who are not violent people or twisted people in any way, but why it's OK
   to go into a movie and enjoy the violence?
T: Yeah, well, it's the movie, it's a fantasy. It's a fantasy, it's not real life. It's a fantasy, you know, you go and you watch a kung-fu movie and one guy
   takes on a hundred people in a restaurant, that's fun!
R: But why are you so sure there's no link between enjoying movie violence and enjoying real violence?
T: I don't uhm... Well, I'm going to tell you why I'm so sure, don't ask me a question like that, I'm not gonna... I'm not biting, I refuse your question.
R: Why?
T: Because I refuse your question, I'm not your slave and you're not my master. You can't make me dance to your tune, I'm not a monkey.
R: I can't make you answer anything, I'm just asking you interesting questions.
T: And I'm saying I refuse.
R: Ok, well, I'm just asking you why, that's fine. But you see, Jamie Foxx has said we can't turn our back and say that violence in films...
T: Well than you should talk to Jamie Foxx about that and I think he's actually here so you can :-D
R: I'd love to, but I mean, you know, it's interesting that you have a different view and I just trying to explore that.
T: And I don't want to! 'cause I'm here to sell my movie. This is a commercial for the movie, make no mistake.
R: But you refuse. So you don't want to talk about anything serious.
T: I don't want to talk about what you want to talk about, I don't want to talk about the implications of violence. The reason I don't want to talk about it
   is 'cause I've said everything I have to say about it. If anyone cares what I have to say about it, they can google me and they can look for 20 years
   what I have to say about it. I haven't changed my opinion one iota.
R: No, but you haven't fleshed it out.
T: It's not my job to flesh it out.
R: No, it's my job to try and ask you to.
T: And I'm shutting your butt down!
R: That's entirely your... entirely your right.
T: This is a commercial for my movie.
R: No, but you know, it's my job to try and explore some serious things as well.
T: I invite you to explore some serious things but not things that I've already been on the record for talking about it.
R: But violence is such a big part of your... all of your movies and it's, you know, and it's an enjoyable part of your movies to so many people and that's why I'm talking about it,
   'cause you know, it's very sensitive time of the moment, the Vice President is talking to the people in the movie industry today about violence and responsility...
T: And you know where I stand on it.
R: Which is "there's no relationship"...
T: Yes!
R: But you haven't said why you think there's no relationship...
T: It's none of your damn business what I think about that!
R: Well, it's my job to ask you why you think...
T: And I'm saying "No!". And I'm shutting you down.
R: But you have a responsibility as a filmmaker surely, to explain a little bit about...
T: No! I don't have any responsibility to explain to you anything I don't want to.
R: No, not to me but to your viewers, to your fans, to people who care what is it that you're doing...
T: They know where I'm coming from. And I have explained it, and I have explained even what you're talking about, I'm just not getting it to you.
R: Why?
T: Because I don't want to, because I've done it already. I have explained this many times in the last 20 years, I just refuse to repeat myself over and over again
   because you want me to. For you and your show. And your ratings.
