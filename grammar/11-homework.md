# Ex 189: Mixed combinations used in a connected passage

During Bill's last term at school, Mr White offered him a job in a hardware shop.
'It would be in the tool section,' he said, 'helping old Mr Hammer, and if you got on you could take over the section when Mr Hammer retires.'
Mr White expected Bill to leap at the offer and was rather taken aback when the boy looked doubtful.
'You needn't make up your mind at once,' he said.
'Mr Hammer can carry on without an assistant for another fortnight.
But think it over and let me know.
Your school breaks up this Friday, doesn't it?'
Bill nodded.
'Well, if you decide to accept the job, look in next weekend. I'll show you round and we'll fix you up with an insurance card.'
Bill's father urged him to accept. 'If you turn it down you'll just be on the dole,' he said.
'It's no use hanging about at home waiting for something better to turn up.
Very few employers are taking on more men at present and a lot of places are closing down'
So Bill took the job and soon settled down in his new environment.
He picked up all the tricks of the trade quickly and when Mr Hammer retired and handed over the tool section to him, he felt very proud of himself.
Unfortunately, after two years Mr White was transferred to a bigger branch and a new manager, Mr Black, was appointed.
He and Bill didn't take to one another at all.
He began, tactlessly enough, by looking Bill up and down and saying, 'I don't care for the way you dress.
If you want to go on working here you must smarten up.
Put on a tie and take off those rings.
I don't approve of young men wearing rings.'
'Some of our customers wear them,' Bill pointed out.
'Don't answer me back!' snapped Mr Black.
Soon afterwards. Bill and the manager fell out again.
'You spend too much time talking to customers,' Mr Black complained.
'But they like a chat,' said another assistant, trying to stand up for Bill.
'People who want silent service go to supermarkets.'
'You keep out of this.' snarled Mr Black.
If business doesn't look up you may both be looking for other jobs.'
'He turns customers off by his bad manner,' muttered Bill to his friends.
'But if profits fall off he'll say that it's all our fault.
Anyway I'm sick of being ordered about and I'm not going to put up with it'
Fortunately, before a rebellion broke out in the tool department, Mr Black was given a more important post.
He became overnight a much happier man and tried to make up for his previous harshness by being very polite to everyone, even Bill.
The staff weren't taken in by his sudden affability, but it made a nice change.
