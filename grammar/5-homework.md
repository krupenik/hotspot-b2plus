Hotel guests who *entertained* in their rooms, or even *drank* alone, often had an inch or two of liquor *left* in bottles at the time of their departure.
*Packing* their bags, most of these guests refrained from *including* the liquor ends, either through fear of leakage or to avoid airline excess baggage charges.
But human psychology made them balk at *pouring* good liquor away and usually it was *left*, intact, on *dressing* tables of the *vacated* rooms.
If a bellboy observed such a residue when *summoned* to carry a guest's bags at checkout time, he was usually back within a few minutes to collect it.
Where guests carried their own bags, as many preferred to do, the floor maid would usually notify a bellboy, who would cut her in on his eventual share of profit.
The dribs and drabs of liquor found their way to the corner of a basement storeroom, the private domain of Herbie Chandler.
It was *preserved* as such through the agency of a storekeeper who, in turn, received help from Chandler with certain larcenies of his own.
The bottles were brought here, usually in laundry bags which bellboys could carry within the hotel without *arousing* comment.
In the course of a day or two the amount *collected* was surprisingly large.
Every two or three days - more frequently if the hotel was busy with conventions - the bell captain consolidated his hoard, as he was *doing* now.
Herbie sorted the bottles *containing* gin into a single group.
*Selecting* two of the more expensive labels, and *employing* a small well-worn funnel, he emptied the other miscellaneous brands into them.
He ended with the first bottle full and the second three quarters full.
He capped them both, *putting* the second bottle aside for *topping* up at the next consolidation.
He repeated the process with bourbon, Scotch, and rye.
In all, there were seven full bottles and several partial ones.
A lonely few ounces of vodka he emptied, after a moment's hesitation, into the gin.
Later in the day the seven full bottles would be *delivered* to a bar a few blocks from the St. Gregory.
The bar owner, only mildly *concerned* with scruples about quality, served the liquor to customers, *paying* Herbie half the going price of regularly *bottled* supplies.
Periodically, for those *involved* within the hotel, Herbie would declare a dividend - usually as small as he dared make it.
