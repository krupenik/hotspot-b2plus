# Has the world become a better place in 21st century? Why? Why not?

What kind of world do we live in? What was it like a century ago? Where is it going? Is it for better or worse?
Let's explore several aspects of that: health, education, economy, violence and environment.

### Health
Key metrics here would probably be infant mortality and life expectancy, and the numbers speak for themselves:
In 1900, global life expectancy was meager 32 years and almost every fifth child died before reaching their first birthday.
Now let's fast forward a little over century to today: as of 2013, global life expectancy is 70 and infant mortality is 3.6%,
all while human population increased about 4 times, from 1.7 billion to 7.1 billion!

### Education
I barely remember my childhood, but I do recall that the Internet wasn't a part of it :-) I grew up with it, I witnessed
the rise of Google, Wikipedia, Coursera and iTunes University. Just fifteen years ago none of these resources for self-directed
learning existed. Today almost 35% of the world has access to the internet and it's educational power.

Here’s what UNESCO has to say about the progress we’ve made over the last 150 years:
> In the mid-nineteenth century, only 10% of the world’s adult population could read or write.
> At the dawn of the twenty-first century, UNESCO estimates that over 80% of adults worldwide can read and write at some minimum level.
> This unprecedented social transformation occurred despite the world’s population quintupling from about 1.2 billion in 1850 to over 6.4 billion [by 2006]…
> Literacy today, in its many manifestations, has become a vital set of competencies and practices, interwoven in the fabric of contemporary societies.

### Economy
The number of people living in extreme poverty (below $1.25/day, as defined by The World Bank) has declined rapidly from 1.9 billion just 50 years ago
to 1.2 billion. We've seen both an absolute decline and even more impressive percentage-based: 42.6% (of 4.5 billion total population) to 17% (of 7.1 billion).
Heard of SpaceX? Who could imagine a private company building spaceships? Well, we have a whole bunch of them now, making it a pretty competitive market.
Some governments are now considering a baseline income as a replacement to social security, isn't that fascinating?

### Violence
Never mind the headlines. We’ve never lived in such peaceful times. You can really only get a sense of how violent the world is, and what the trends are, if you count.
During the WWII, the most violent war we've had so far, the human population lost about 300 of every 100,000 people *each year*. Later on, during the Korean War,
it was 20-30, dropping into teens in Vietnam. After that it went into single digits and for the most of 21st century it's been *below 1* war death per 100k people per year.

### Environment
Sustainability is an issue, but I'm going to argue that the advances in technology and public awareness will allow us to become carbon neutral sometime soon.
Just remember: the planet isn't going anywhere, we are! I really hope people will learn to leave the nature alone until it's too late.

## Conclusion
So has the world become a better place in 21st century? In my opinion, the answer to the research question is a resounding YES!
