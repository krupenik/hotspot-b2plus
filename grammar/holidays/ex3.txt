There was a knock on the door. I opened it and found a small dark man in a blue overcoat and woollen cap.
He said he was an employee of the gas company and had come to read the meter.
But I had a suspicion that he wasn't speaking the truth because the meter readers usually wear peaked caps.
Howewer, I took him to the meter, which is in a dark corner under the stairs (meters are usually in dark corners under the stairs).
I asked if he had a torch; he said he disliked torches and always read meters by the light of a match.
I remarked that if there was a leak in the gaspipe there might be an explosion while he was reading the meter.
He said, 'As a matter of fact, there was an explosion in the last house I visited; and Mr. Smith, the owner of the house, was burnt in the face.'
'Mr. Smith was holding a lighted match at the time of the explosion.'
To prevent a possible repetition of this accident, I lent him a torch.
He switched on the torch, read the meter and wrote the reading down on the back of an envelope.
I said in a surprise that the meter readers usually put the readings down in the book.
He said that he had had the book but that it had been burnt in the fire in the Mr Smith's house.
By this time I had come to the conclusion that he wasn't a genuine meter reader; and the moment he left the house I rang the police.
Are John and Mary cousins? ~ No, they aren't cousins; they are brother and sister.
The fog was so thick that we couldn't see the side of the road. We followed the car in front of us and hoped that we were going the right way.
