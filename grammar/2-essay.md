If you could change one important thing about your country, what would you change?

People. People are key and this is true about any country in the world.

People should care about one another and our surroundings way more than they do. Virtually every
deficiency in any country stems from people not caring enough about the problem so nothing (or very
little) is done about it. Name just about any, be it poverty, corruption, pollution, waste,
inefficient production, unemployment â€” the main reason is there's very few people that are not only
"deeply concerned" but actually try and act to fix the underlying issue.

One pretty illustrative example is street cleanliness. No one actually bothers to think about the
root cause, which is, surprisingly, as simple as open ground. This should be the starting point.
Then the country will feature grass lawns and stone chips everywhere and people might start
shampooing their sidewalks as they do pretty much everywhere else in developed countries. But since
we don't care, we don't push those legally and technically responsible for public services
improvements and we get exactly what we deserve for our efforts: dust and dirt all over the place.

People should start giving a damn.
