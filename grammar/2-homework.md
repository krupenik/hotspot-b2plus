1. He gave me back the book, thanked me for lending it to him and said that he had enjoyed it very much;
but I knew that he hadn't read it because the 50 dollar bill I had left inside was still there, on the same page!

2. When he saw his wife off at the station, he returned home as he didn't have to be at the airport till 9.30.

3. He didn't have to pack, for his wife had already done that for him and his case was ready in the hall.

4. He didn't have to check the doors and windows either, for his wife always did that before she left the house.

5. All he had to do was to decide whether or not to take his overcoat with him. In the end he decided not to.

6. At 8.30 he picked up his case, went out of the house and slammed the door behind him.

7. Then he felt in his pockets for the key, for his wife had reminded him to double-lock the front door.

8. When he had searched all his pockets and found no key he remembered where it was.

9. He had left it in his overcoat pocket.

10. Then he remembered something else; his passport and tickets were in his overcoat pocket as well.

11. I arrived in England in the middle of July. I had been told that England was shrouded in fog all year round,
so I was quite surprised to find that it was merely raining.

12. I asked another passenger, an Englishman, about the fog and he said that there hadn't been any since the previous February.

13. If I wanted fog, he said, I had come at quite the wrong time.

14. However, he told me that I could buy tinned fog at a shop in Shaftesbury Avenue.

15. He admitted that he had never bought fog there himself but assured me
that they were selling good quality fog and that it wasn't expensive. I suppose he was joking.

16. When the old lady returned to her flat she saw at once that burglars had broken in during her absence,
because the front door was open and everything in the flat was upside down.

17. The burglars themselves were no longer there, but they probably had only just left
because a cigarette was still burning on an ornamental table.

18. Probably they had heard the lift coming up and had run down the fire escape.

19. They had helped themselves to her whisky too but there was a little left, so she poured herself out a drink.

20. She wondered if they had found her jewellery and rather hoped that they had.

21. The jewellery had been given to her by her husband, who had died some years before.

22. Since his death she hadn't had the heart to wear it, yet she didn't like to sell it.

23. Now it seemed that fate had taken the matter out of her hands; and certainly the insurance money would come in handy.

24. I put the £5 note into one of my books; but the next day it took me ages to find it
because I had forgotten which book I had put it into.

25. A woman came in with a baby, who she said just had swallowed a safety pin.

spending so much time near my house, to which he replied that he was looking for a C-note which he had lost in the neighbourhood the day before.
I couldn't see any bills near the house, but there was a notebook which he probably dropped when I suddenly opened the door.

# Contexts

## A

This time last year I was cycling in the rain along a country road in France with a friend of mine.

We had decided to go on a cycling holiday in Normandy.

Neither of us had been to France before, but we knew some French from our time at school and we had managed to brush up on the basics.

Now we were wondering if we had made the right decision.

We had planned our route carefully in advance but we had forgotten one important thing, the weather.

It had been raining solidly since our arrival and that night we ended up sleeping in the waiting room at a railway station.

Then the next morning as we were riding down a steep hill my bike skidded on the wet road and I fell off.

I realized immediately that I had broken my arm and after a visit to the local hospital I caught the next train to Calais
for the ferry home.

Unfortunately my parents weren't expecting me home for a fortnight and had gone away on holiday.

So I spent a miserable couple of weeks alone, reading _Teach Yourself French_.

## B

Harry went back to the camp the following morning, but it was in some confusion.

Soldiers were wandering around carrying equipment from one place to another, but there didn't seem to be any purpose 
to what they were doing.

Harry had never been in an army camp before, but it didn't take a genius to realize that most of the officers had taken
the first opportunity to abandon the men and head for safety.

He tried to phone the newspaper but something had happened to the telephone lines.

He tried to find out what exactly was going on when the first plane flew over the camp.

A wooden building a few hundred yards away suddenly disappeared in an explosion of flame.

Before long bombs were exploding all around him and then everything went quiet.

The planes vanished as suddenly as they had appeared.

Smoke was rising from burning buildings.

A dead man was lying next to Harry, the first dead person he had ever seen.

And suddenly it began to rain.
